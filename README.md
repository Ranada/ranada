# Hey I'm Neil 👋

I've spent six years working as a UX designer and project manager. I’ve launched new web apps and fixed up old ones from the design and planning side. 

Now, I'm working on building these things as a  **C#** and **ASP.NET Core** software developer. 

Let's connect to discuss how I can bring value to your team.  

I recently designed a dashboard web application and company website for Hoste, a fast-growing vacation rental management business. View the live site at: https://hoste.com/

I spent three years at UEGroup, a Silicon Valley-based UX firm, working with clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies.
My most notable UX projects include leading the creation of a design system for a medical device company and the modernization of digital tools for an aviation company.

I'm in the middle of a professional rebranding where I did UX work under my company, Yoko Digital. I'm shifting focus to developing ASP.NET Core web applications and building my portfolio. https://www.yokodigital.co/

🚁 I'm also a veteran U.S. Navy helicopter pilot and program manager. The most fulfilling time of my flying career was transporting injured people and delivering relief supplies after Haiti's 7.0 magnitude earthquake in 2010. 

⭐️ I'm available for software engineering opportunities in Los Angeles County, Orange County, Washington State, or remote roles.
