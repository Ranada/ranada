### Hey I'm Neil 👋
 
I am a Software Engineer with five years of experience as a User Experience (UX) professional. I spent three years at UEGroup, a Silicon
Valley-based UX firm, working with clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies. I specialize in aligning User Interfaces (UI) by
applying UX best practices and lessons learned. I use my knowledge of layouts, components, and workflows while programming. I enjoy organizing data through logical problem-solving and displaying it on a screen. 

I am also a US Navy veteran. I served ten years as a former helicopter pilot and program manager.
