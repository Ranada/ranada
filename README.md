# Hey I'm Neil 👋

I'm a commercial-rated pilot who enjoys learning programming. Previously, I've spent six years working as a UX designer and project manager. I’ve launched new web apps and fixed up old ones from the design and planning side. 

I've designed a dashboard web application and company website for Hoste, a fast-growing vacation rental management business. View the live dashboard web application at: https://owner.hoste.com/

I spent three years at UEGroup, a Silicon Valley-based UX firm, working with clients ranging from startups to Fortune 500 companies.
My most notable UX projects include leading the development of a design system for a medical device company and modernizing digital tools for an aviation company.

⭐️ I'm available for software-related opportunities in Los Angeles County, Orange County, Washington State, or remote roles.
